.SH NAME
Quadrilateral Cowboy, by Blendo Games (2016)
.SH INTRODUCTION
The engine noise from your jetbike rises to a loud purr and then gradually
subsides after you press your foot down on the pedal, adding a small burst of
acceleration to navigate the final segment of the near-pitch-black railway
tunnel.

You can see the light from the rear carriage and hear the faint, doppler-\
shifting sound of a bell as it swings from side-to-side on the train ahead.
Your adrenaline levels are rising, the way that they always do at the start of
a new job - and, almost ritually, you relax momentarily on the bike, don your
headphones, and reach for your pocket vinylman.

You press 'play', and there's a satisfying 'ch-click' sound as the blocky
plastic button locks into place, the neighbouring 'stop' button simultaneously
springing back into level with the adjacent controls.

It's time to get to work...
